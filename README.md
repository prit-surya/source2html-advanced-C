Source2html - README


Project Overview
Source2html is a tool designed to convert source code files into HTML format, allowing you to view formatted source code in a web browser. The project utilizes a parser engine to read through source code files and translate various elements (such as keywords, comments, and constants) into HTML with appropriate syntax highlighting.


Key Features
Converts source code files into HTML for easy web display.
Applies syntax highlighting to reserved keywords, preprocessor directives, constants, and other code elements.
Optional line numbering for HTML output.
Customizable color schemes for different code elements.


How it Works
Input: The program takes a source code file as input.
Parsing: It parses the file and identifies elements like comments, preprocessor directives, constants, etc.
HTML Generation: The parsed elements are transformed into an HTML format, where specific code elements are wrapped in corresponding HTML tags and styles.
Output: The resulting HTML file can be opened in any web browser to view the source code with syntax highlighting.
